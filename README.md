# 🌼 Machine Learning Basics with SVM and Linear Regression

This repository contains a beginner-friendly collection of machine learning implementations using Python and Scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to perform classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and regression using Linear Regression on popular datasets such as Iris and Breast Cancer.

## 📚 What's Inside?

### 1. **Iris Dataset Classification (SVM)**
- Uses both 2-feature and 4-feature models.
- Visualizations: scatter plots and histograms.
- Predicts the species of Iris flower based on input features.

### 2. **Breast Cancer Dataset Classification (SVM)**
- Applies SVM to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- Includes performance evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score)

### 3. **Linear Regression**
- Simple regression using synthetic data.
- Shows how to fit a line using `scipy.stats.linregress`.
- Visualizes the regression line and evaluates correlation (`r-value`).

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn scipy seaborn
```
